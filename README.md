Public Transport Route Planning Graphs and Algorithm

Public transport is an indispensable part of any city. In a metropolitan like Delhi, with complex and multi-modal public transport network, it is imperative to enhance and develop the public transport sector using the state-of-art technologies.

This project aims at utilizing the Open Transit Data (Delhi) which is in General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format to build a Public Transport Route Planning algorithm that takes into account the realtime data of buses to return results. It also returns multi-modal (metro + bus) and metro only or bus only results including both realtime and static results. The algorithm can easily be deployed for any city with GTFS data with minor changes in the graph and dependent static files.

The route planning is a feature of the Chartr App (availble on PlayStore) which offers many more Public Transport centric services such as Contactless Ticketing for Buses, Realtime information of location of buses, incoming buses at a stop and occupancy data of bus and metro. The project is developed at the Mobility and Optimisation Lab at IIIT Delhi under the guidance of Dr. Pravesh Biyani and with a spectacular team of colleagues.

The repository is divided into two parts: realtime and static. Each has its own set of algorithm, graphs and dependent files.
